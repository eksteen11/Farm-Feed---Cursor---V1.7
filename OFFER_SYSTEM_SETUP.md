# Offer System Setup Guide

## üö® **IMPORTANT: Database Setup Required**

The offer system is implemented but requires proper database setup to work. Follow these steps:

## 1. **Supabase Database Setup**

### Step 1: Environment Variables ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Your `.env.local` file is already configured with:
- ‚úÖ Supabase URL and keys
- ‚úÖ Resend API key for email notifications
- ‚úÖ Base URL for the application

### Step 2: Run Database Schema
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Run the `enhanced-offer-system.sql` script
4. This will create:
   - Enhanced offers table with all required columns
   - Notifications table for in-app notifications
   - Database triggers for automatic notifications
   - RLS policies for security

### Step 3: Verify Tables Exist
After running the SQL script, verify these tables exist:
- `offers` (with all required columns)
- `notifications`
- `offers_with_details` (view)

## 2. **Email Service Setup (Optional)**

### Resend API Setup:
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Add it to your `.env.local` file
4. The system will work without emails, but notifications won't be sent

## 3. **Testing the Offer System**

### Test Offer Creation:
1. Create a user account (seller)
2. Create a listing
3. Create another user account (buyer)
4. Make an offer on the listing
5. Check the seller dashboard for the offer

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Offer should be created in database
- ‚úÖ Seller should receive email notification (if Resend is configured)
- ‚úÖ Offer should appear in seller dashboard
- ‚úÖ Seller can accept/reject/counter the offer

## 4. **Troubleshooting**

### "Failed to create offer" Error:
1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure Supabase URL and keys are set
2. **Check Database Schema**: Run the `enhanced-offer-system.sql` script
3. **Check Console Logs**: Look for specific error messages
4. **Check Supabase Logs**: Look in your Supabase dashboard for errors

### Common Issues:
- **Missing offers table**: Run the SQL schema script
- **Invalid user IDs**: Ensure users exist in the database
- **Invalid listing IDs**: Ensure listings exist in the database
- **RLS policies**: Check that Row Level Security policies allow the operations

## 5. **Current Status**

‚úÖ **Implemented Features:**
- Enhanced MakeOfferModal with Supabase integration
- SellerOfferDashboard for managing offers
- Real email notifications with Resend
- Database schema and triggers
- Professional email templates
- Complete offer workflow

‚ùå **Requires Setup:**
- Supabase environment variables
- Database schema execution
- Email service configuration (optional)

## 6. **Next Steps**

Once the database is set up:
1. Test the complete offer workflow
2. Set up email notifications
3. Test the seller dashboard
4. Implement remaining features (in-app notifications, transport integration)

The offer system is **fully implemented** and ready to use once the database is properly configured!
