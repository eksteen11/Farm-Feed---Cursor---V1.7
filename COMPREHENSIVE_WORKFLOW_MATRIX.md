## üéâ **CONCLUSION**

This matrix provides a **complete roadmap** for building the interconnected Farm Feed ecosystem. By developing all three user workflows in parallel and focusing on the critical path dependencies, we can rapidly build a fully functional agricultural marketplace.

**The key insight**: Each user's action triggers responses from others, so we must build the complete system together rather than in isolation.
