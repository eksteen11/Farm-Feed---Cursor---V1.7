## 🔧 **Technical Details:**

### **Store Structure:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
mockOffers.push(newOffer)           // ❌ Modifies static data
set({ offers: [...get().offers, newOffer] })

// After (FIXED):
set({ offers: [...get().offers, newOffer] })  // ✅ Only store state
```

### **Dashboard Data Source:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const buyerOffers = mockOffers.filter(...)  // ❌ Static data

// After (FIXED):
const { offers } = useStore()
const buyerOffers = offers.filter(...)      // ✅ Store state
```

### **Update Functions:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const offerIndex = mockOffers.findIndex(...)  // ❌ Static data lookup

// After (FIXED):
const currentOffers = get().offers            // ✅ Store state lookup
const offerIndex = currentOffers.findIndex(...)
```

---

## 📊 **Expected Data Flow:**

1. **Buyer creates offer** → Store updates `offers` array
2. **Buyer dashboard** → Reads from `useStore().offers` → Shows new offer
3. **Seller dashboard** → Reads from `useStore().offers` → Shows incoming offer
4. **Seller responds** → Store updates offer status
5. **Both dashboards** → Re-render with updated data
